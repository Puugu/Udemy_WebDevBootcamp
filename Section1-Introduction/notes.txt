- notes from syllabus review
	* coding starts in HTML and CSS units
	* Bootstrap is a CSS and JS framework
	* HTML and CSS make things look good
	* JavaScript is everything else (provides action)
	* When we get to the Backend section, we'll start using command line for everything else in the course
	* YelpCamp will be a bigger project with lots of growth throughout the course to combine everything together
	* Refactoring is moving around and rewriting code so that it's cleaner/shorter/more modular
